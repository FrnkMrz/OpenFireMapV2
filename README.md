# OpenFireMapV2

OpenFireMapV2 is a personal, non-commercial project focused on learning Git, GitHub, and modern CI/CD workflows, using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and ideas inspired by the original OpenFireMap.

I originally launched one of the first OSM-based hydrant maps and have owned the domain **openfiremap.org** for roughly 15 years. This repository is a continuation of that idea, rebuilt from scratch with a modern toolchain and a strong focus on practical experimentation.

## Purpose

This project exists for learning and experimentation.

- Git and GitHub workflows
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automated builds and deployments
- Working with OpenStreetMap data
- Frontend and backend prototyping
- “Vibe coding” without pressure or deadlines

## Scope

- No commercial intent
- No production guarantees
- No SLA
- No promises beyond “this worked on my machine”

Changes may be frequent, opinionated, or intentionally experimental.

## Philosophy

- Learn by building
- Break things on purpose
- Keep everything transparent
- Prefer simple, readable solutions over clever ones

If something looks unfinished, it probably is. That’s the point.
